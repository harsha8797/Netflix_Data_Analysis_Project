There are 10 missing values in date_added both before and after attempting to convert it to a datetime format, indicating these records are genuinely missing the date they were added to Netflix. Depending on the analysis, we might consider removing these records or imputing them based on the release_year or other logic.

We removed duplicates based on show_id, ensuring each record in the dataset is unique.
